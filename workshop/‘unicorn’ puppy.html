   <P><strong><em>Narwhal<sup>1</sup> is by many measures anormal puppy. Caregivers say he likes to nibble on fingers and give a kisses and wants to play with anyone nearby.</em></strong>On the other hand,he also has a second tail sprouting from his forehead- an appendage that's prompted the nickname "unicorn puppy" and captivated dog lovers in the days since a Missouri rescue group brought him in from the side of a road.</P>

   <p>"We are so stupid excited about it," said Rochelle Steffen, who found the Jackson, Mo.-based organization that's caring Narwhal. Steffen's group, <a href=" https://www.macsmission.org/">Mac's Mission</a>, focuses on <s>unicorn</s> "special needs" dogs that requrire extra medical care due to birth defects, injuries or abuse. Staff see horrific cases of pets who've been shot, run over or abandoned, Steffen told The Washington Post. They rescue animals that might get euthanizaed elsewhere and then help them find permanent homes.</p>
